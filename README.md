# SplitCpp

This program facilitates bill splitting. Users input their names, and then manage shared expenses paid by individuals, resulting in a message indicating who owes what to whom and how much (current balance).

The data, including the number of participants, participants' names, and the debt matrix, is stored using a structure. The code comprises the following functions:
- groupInitialize: Creates a new group of users.
- showDebtsTable: Displays the current debt matrix.
- showBalance: Displays the current balance.
- addExpense: Adds a new expense.
